[Online Help](https://elasticpost.readthedocs.io/) (Under writing)

([Here](https://github.com/hitliaomq/MaterialPOST/blob/master/ElasticPOST/Video/ElasticPOST-An%20Introduction.mp4) is a brief video tutorial, and [here](https://github.com/hitliaomq/MaterialPOST/blob/master/ElasticPOST/Manual/ElasticPOST%20Manual(Chinese).pdf) is an unfinished manual [in Chinese])

## INSTALLATION

- From source code

  **MATLAB required**

  

- From exe file

  **MATLAB runtime required. (free but about 2.5Gb)**

  Run `ElasticPOST_GUI.exe` in the `bin` folder. Note: `MATLAB Runtime` is required. The code can download and install it for you. (About **2.5Gb**)

## FUNCTIONS

ElasticPOST is an open source academic free software
It is design for post processing of the elastic stiffness matrix

## FEATHERS
1. For 3D materials in any symmetry, supporting the elastic anisotropy of bulk modulus, Young's modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio and hardness in 3D;
2. For 2D materials in any symmetry, supporting the elastic anisotropy of Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio;
3. Supporting *.xlsx, *.xls, *.txt, *.dat and *.mat data format;
4. Supporting Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation to average the elastic modulus;
5. Supply some useful tools for 3D figures, such as slice and view point;
6. Supporting *.tif, *.jpg, *.emf, *.eps, *pdf, *.fig figure format;
7. Supporting Windows and Linux system;
8. It will give some tips for errors.
